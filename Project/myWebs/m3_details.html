                                Several years ago, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began looking into 
                                a new medical procedure called transcranial direct-current stimulation, or tDCS. To the outsider,
                                the experiments looked more Mary Shelley than cutting-edge neurology. Scientists taped sponges laced
                                with metal to various parts of a patient’s scalp and then hooked them up to a small 9-volt battery
                                — just like the ones that go in smoke detectors or old transistor radios. Then the scientists sent
                                a small electrical pulse to the brain and watched to see what would happen.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                What they discovered was extraordinary: Stroke patients improved their motor skills,
                                chronic pain sufferers appeared to find relief, and the stimulation seemed to help some 
                                patients with learning. It was this last revelation that interested DARPA most.
                                The agency gave scientists at the University of New Mexico a grant to see whether tDCS 
                                might have a military application — specifically, whether it could be used to help soldiers 
                                train faster.

                                Entertaining the idea of a better military through the judicious use of a 9-volt battery 
                                goes a long way toward explaining why the mere mention of DARPA often is accompanied by a 
                                full caseload of moral judgments. The agency has long had a habit of eschewing political 
                                correctness and shrugging off what people might say or think so it can put science first. 
                                It has never worried about how unconventional research might look on the front page of, say, 
                                The Washington Post. That attitude has led to notable successes but also some troubling outcomes. 
                                DARPA is responsible for stealth technology, tank simulators and the M-16 rifle on the one side of 
                                the ledger, but on the other side data-mining programs such as Total Information Awareness and the 
                                research that led to harsh interrogation techniques used on prisoners after 9/11.

                                Annie Jacobsen explores that tension in her fascinating new book, “The Pentagon’s Brain,” 
                                which she presents as the first comprehensive history of an agency many Americans may not even 
                                know exists. Jacobsen tracks DARPA’s beginnings as an informal gathering of scientists struggling 
                                with problems of the Cold War and allows readers to see its transformation into what it is today: 
                                a high-tech incubator that introduces the newest technologies, for good or ill, to soldiers on the 
                                battlefield.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                According to Jacobsen, many of DARPA’s original members were working in the Southern California 
                                offices of the Rand Corp. think tank in the 1950s. At the time, they were churning out reports 
                                about nuclear weaponry and doomsday scenarios. Jacobsen writes that “competition was valued and 
                                encouraged at RAND, with scientists and analysts always working to outdo one another.” And nowhere 
                                was that competitive spirit more apparent than at lunchtime, when the scientists began playing 
                                Kriegspiel, a chess variant once favored by the German military. With maps of the world spread 
                                across lunch tables, the great minds of the Cold War era would spend hours on the game. “Lunchtime
                                war games included at least one person in the role of umpire,” Jacobsen writes, “which usually 
                                prevented competitions from getting out of hand. Still, tempers flared, and sometimes game pieces
                                scattered.”
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                The master of these games, by Jacobsen’s account, was a mathematician and former child prodigy 
                                named John von Neumann. He was considered so bright that he was hired by Rand’s mathematics division
                                on rather unusual terms: He was supposed to “write down his thoughts each morning while shaving, 
                                and for those ideas he would be paid $200 a month — the average salary of a full-time RAND analyst
                                at the time.” Eventually, he was also charged with a rather delicate project. He performed the precise
                                calculations that determined at what altitude over Hiroshima and Nagasaki the atomic bombs had to 
                                explode in order to kill the maximum number of civilians on the ground. He determined that height 
                                was 1,800 feet.
