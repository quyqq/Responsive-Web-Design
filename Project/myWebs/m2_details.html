                                One of the earliest explorations of the concept of the combat drone was by Lee De Forest, 
                                an early inventor of radio devices, and U. A. Sanabria, a TV engineer. 
                                They presented their idea in an article in a 1940 publication of Popular Mechanics. 
                                The modern military drone as known today was the brainchild of John Stuart Foster Jr., 
                                a nuclear physicist and former head of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
                                (then called the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory). In 1971, Foster was a model aeroplane
                                hobbyist and had the idea this hobby could be applied to building weapons. He drew up plans 
                                and by 1973 DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) built two prototypes called 
                                "Prairie" and "Calera". They were powered by a modified lawn-mower engine and could stay 
                                aloft for two hours while carrying a 28-pound (13 kg) load.

                                In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used unarmed U.S. 
                                Ryan Firebee target drones to spur Egypt into firing its entire arsenal 
                                of anti-aircraft missiles. This mission was accomplished with no injuries to Israeli 
                                pilots, who soon exploited the depleted Egyptian defences. In the late 1970s and 80s, 
                                Israel developed the Scout and the Pioneer, which represented a shift toward the lighter, 
                                glider-type model of UAV in use today. Israel pioneered the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) 
                                for real-time surveillance, electronic warfare, and decoys. The images and radar decoying provided 
                                by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defences in Operation Mole Cricket 
                                19 at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed.

                            <p>
                                Impressed by Israel's success, the US quickly acquired a number of UAVs, and its Hunter 
                                and Pioneer systems are direct derivatives of Israeli models. 
                                The first 'UAV war' was the first Gulf War: according to a May 1991 
                                Department of the Navy report: "At least one UAV was airborne at all 
                                times during Desert Storm." After the Gulf War successfully demonstrated 
                                its utility, global militaries invested widely in the domestic development 
                                of combat UAVs. The first "kill" by an American UAV was on October 7, 2001, in Kandahar.

                                In recent years, the U.S. has increased its use of drone strikes against targets in foreign countries and elsewhere 
                                as part of the War on Terror. In January 2014, it was estimated that 2,400 people have died from U.S. drone strikes 
                                in five years. In June 2015 the total death toll of U.S. drone strikes was estimated to exceed 6,000.
