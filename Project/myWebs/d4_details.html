                                ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) is a humanoid robot created by Honda in 2000. 
                                It is currently displayed in the Miraikan museum in Tokyo, Japan. On July 8, 2018, 
                                Honda posted the last update of Asimo through their official page stating that it would be 
                                ceasing all development and production of Asimo robots in order to focus on more practical 
                                applications using the technology developed through Asimoâ€™s lifespan.[1] The name was chosen 
                                in honor of Isaac Asimov.

                                Honda began developing humanoid robots in the 1980s, including several prototypes that preceded ASIMO. 
                                It was the company's goal to create a walking robot. E0 was the first bipedal (two-legged) model produced 
                                as part of the Honda E series, which was an early experimental line of self-regulating, humanoid walking 
                                robot with wireless movements created between 1986 and 1993.[3][4] This was followed by the Honda P series 
                                of robots produced from 1993 through 1997. The research made on the E- and P-series led to the creation of ASIMO. 
                                Development began at Honda's Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center in Japan in 1999 and ASIMO was unveiled in 
                                October 2000.[5][6] ASIMO is an acronym which stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility.[7] The Japanese word 
                                Asi also stands for 'leg' and Mo for 'mobility'. ASIMO is pronounced as 'ashimo' and means 'also legs'.
                                In 2018, Honda ceased the commercial development of ASIMO, although it will continue to be developed as a 
                                research platform and make public appearances.

                                ASIMO stands 130 cm (4 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 54 kg (119 lb). 
                                Research conducted by Honda found that the ideal height for a mobility 
                                assistant robot was between 120 cm and the height of an average adult, 
                                which is conducive to operating door knobs and light switches.[3][9] ASIMO 
                                is powered by a rechargeable 51.8 V lithium-ion battery with an operating time 
                                of one hour. Switching from a nickel metal hydride in 2004 increased the amount of time 
                                ASIMO can operate before recharging.[10] ASIMO has a three-dimensional computer processor 
                                that was created by Honda and consists of a three stacked die, a processor, a signal converter 
                                and memory.[11] The computer that controls ASIMO's movement is housed in the robot's waist area 
                                and can be controlled by a PC, wireless controller, or voice commands.[12]
