                                There is an increasing fascination with robots that goes anywhere from the mundane of robots that 
                                clean the floors, to extremists who are implanting chips in themselves and calling themselves cyborgs.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                Robots are more prevalent than ever, and the practical uses are growing in a big way. For the most 
                                part South Korea and the Japanese have taken the lead in robotics, at least in the marketing an 
                                notoriety side of it, as they create robots that have some similarities to human expression in order 
                                to create interest in order to get research money.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                In reality, it's debatable whether anyone really has the robotics lead right now, other than 
                                who's positioning themselves the best to garner research money. For example, there are a ton 
                                of industrial robots in the U.S., which have been used for years for assembly, and are of course
                                called robotic arms. That doesn't get much attention because it doesn't have the sexy side of 
                                mimicking humans included.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                And who gets excited about robotic lawn mowers or carpet and floor cleaners? Not too many people do. 
                                But when you add the human element to it, which in reality is the least valuable, it generates 
                                interest and funding, and offers the illusion that there are great strides being made in robotics.
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                So for better or worse, we're going to see a lot more of this in the future, even though human 
                                acting robots really have no practical use. Some say they'd be good for companions to the elderly,
                                but when you think of that it's really nonsense. You would have to have someone not able to 
                                distinguish between a human and a robot for that to happen, which means they'd be past the ability 
                                to distinguish between the two, so how does that help?
                            </p><br/>
                            <p>
                                In the case of these types of robots, it really is all a marketing ploy, 
                                and nothing more.Now as far as robots that are made to do mundane tasks in hospitals 
                                that walk upright, that does have a practical side, and it makes sense because of the 
                                hallways and tasks needed to be done.The difference is they're not there to fool someone, 
                                they're actually there for a task, and standing upright coincides with that task.
